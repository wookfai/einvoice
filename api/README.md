## üìñ Introduction

XAgent is an open-source experimental Large Language Model (LLM) driven autonomous agent that can automatically solve various tasks. 
It is designed to be a general-purpose agent that can be applied to a wide range of tasks. XAgent is still in its early stages, and we are working hard to improve it.

üèÜ Our goal is to create a super-intelligent agent that can solve any given task!

We welcome diverse forms of collaborations, including full-time and part-time roles and more. If you are interested in the frontiers of agents and want to join us in realizing true autonomous agents, please contact us at xagentteam@gmail.com.

XAgent is designed with the following features:
- **Autonomy**: XAgent can automatically solve various tasks without human participation.
- **Safety**: XAgent is designed to run safely. All actions are constrained inside a docker container. Run it anyway!
- **Extensibility**: XAgent is designed to be extensible. You can easily add new tools to enhance agent's abilities and even new agentsÔºÅ
- **GUI**: XAgent provides a friendly GUI for users to interact with the agent. You can also use the command line interface to interact with the agent.
- **Cooperation with Human**: XAgent can collaborate with you to tackle tasks. It not only has the capability to follow your guidance in solving complex tasks on the go but it can also seek your assistance when it encounters challenges.
